**Minecraft Status Checker**

This script checks if a Minecraft username is a paid account or a "crack" account. If the account is a paid account, it uses the user's ID from the Mojang API. If the account is a "crack" account, it uses the user's ID generated by the offlinePlayerUuid function.

How it works
The script takes a Minecraft username and makes a GET request to the Mojang API for information about the user's profile. If the user's profile does not exist (HTTP code 204), this means the user has a paid account and the script uses the user's ID from the Mojang API. If the user's profile does exist (HTTP code 200), this means the user has a "crack" account and the script uses the user's ID generated by the offlinePlayerUuid function.

The offlinePlayerUuid function generates a UUID based on a given Minecraft username and the createJavaUuid function converts the generated UUID into the Java UUID format.

The result is returned as a JSON array containing the "name", "status", and "id" elements.

**Usage**
To use the script, simply make a GET request to /status_check.php with the username parameter set to the desired Minecraft username.

For example:

```
/status_check.php?username=Notch
```

```
{
  "name": "Notch",
  "status": "paid",
  "id": "069a79f4-44e9-4726-a5be-fca90e38aaf5"
}
```
